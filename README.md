## Hi there, I'm ≈Åukasz Kƒôdzierski!

I'm a Python developer implementing solutions for autonomous mobile robots. My work involves using ROS2 LiDAR-based odometry and SLAM algorithms, as well as pointcloud-based object detection algorithms to tackle navigation challenges in robotics. I'm currently finishing my graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the Lodz University of Technology.
